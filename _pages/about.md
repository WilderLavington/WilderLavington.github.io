Basic info
------

Does the policy loss matter in off policy reinforcement learning?
------
RL as inference gives us a variety of new losses to play with in RL, but does the loss we pick actually matter so long as we maintain either entropy or trust region restrictions within our algorithm

What are the limits introduced by information asymmetry in both reinforcement and imitation learning?
------
Asymmetric Learning and ttaking advantage of easy to generate expert policies within simulation

In a reasonbly new area of applied research, what works and what doesn't?
------
The intersection of Imitation Learning and Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Vehicles

What does a good feature space for deep reinfrocement learning actually look like?
------
Figuring out exactly why image based actor critic models work as well sa they do

Is safe reinforcement learning possible?
------
Safe Reinforcement Learning and constrained policy optimization
