PhD student studying the intersection of optimization and reinforcment learning under Mark Schmidt and Frank Wood at UBC in the department of Computer Science. I am originally from Boulder CO, and enjoy climbing, skiing, trail running, and mountain biking. My current projects focus on taking advatage of additional information in simulators for autonoumous vehicles, and how to make popular deeplearning algorithms more stable in general continuous control environments. In the past I have researched the reinforcement learning as inference framework, and before that some mathematical biology.
